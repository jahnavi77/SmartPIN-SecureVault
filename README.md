# SmartPIN-SecureVault
Smart Pin Secure Vault is an 8051-based embedded prototype: users enter a 4-digit PIN on a 4×3 keypad, which drives an L293D-controlled motor to lock/unlock a door. Status is shown on a 16×2 LCD, a buzzer sounds on wrong PIN, and SMS alerts (via MAX232→GSM) notify each open/close. Developed in Embedded C with Keil μVision and simulated in Proteus.
